# Frontend Playground

I made this playground sandbox to try out new things, and develop my own HTML-CSS-JS web components that are
independent from frameworks and libraries like jQuery or Google's Material Design Lite.

The components are highly based on my previous idea, named as `Thomas Component Framework`. Let's see where can I
get with this.

## Installation

Simply run:

```bash
$> npm install
```

## Build

This project uses `webpack` to test and compile distribution codes. To build the project, run:

```bash
$> npm run build
```

## See results

To see the results after the build was successful, just execute:

```bash
$> npm run demo
```
